# CORD--19-Kaggle-Challenge---Deriving-Insights-for-COVID-19-Combat
In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, the White House and a coalition of leading research groups have prepared a dataset of open sourced research papers. This data-set is a resource of over 45,000 scholarly articles, including over 33,000 with full text, about COVID-19, SARSCoV- 2, and related coronaviruses. This freely available dataset is provided to the global research community to apply recent advances in natural language processing and other AI techniques to generate new insights in support of the ongoing fight against this infectious disease. There is a growing urgency for these approaches because of the rapid acceleration in new coronavirus literature, making it difficult for the medical research community to keep up and extract insight from this growing body work. The goal of this project is to use NLP and other machine learning algorithms learned in this course to develop a tool that can text-mine this database of research articles to gain useful insights about COVID-19 and how we might be able to tackle the outbreak, contain the spread and flatten the curve.
